In this assignment, you will create a program that simulates the game Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock. This is a variation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game with additional choices: Lizard and Spock. Your program will allow a user to play against the computer by selecting one of the five options, with the computer randomly choosing its move. After each round, the program will declare the winner based on the rules below.

## Rules:
- Scissors cut paper
- Paper covers rock
- Rock crushes lizard
- Lizard poisons Spock
- Spock smashes (or melts) scissors
- Scissors decapitate lizard
- Lizard eats paper
- Paper disproves Spock
- Spock vaporizes rock
- Rock breaks scissors


##Requirements:
The user should be prompted to select an option (Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, or Spock).
The computer should randomly select one of the five options.
The program should compare the user's choice and the computer's choice to determine the winner using the rules above.
Display the result of each round, showing both the user and computerâ€™s choices, and declare a winner, loser, or tie.
Implement the game logic using conditional statements and loops to allow the user to play multiple rounds.
You must also keep track of the score and display the overall winner after multiple rounds (when the user chooses to stop).
